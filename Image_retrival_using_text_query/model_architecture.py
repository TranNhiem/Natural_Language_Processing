Description: Implementation of a dual encoder model for retrieving images that match natural language queries.

 View in Colab â€¢ GitHub source

Introduction
The example demonstrates how to build a dual encoder (also known as two-tower) neural network model to search for images using natural language. The model is inspired by the CLIP approach, introduced by Alec Radford et al. The idea is to train a vision encoder and a text encoder jointly to project the representation of images and their captions into the same embedding space, such that the caption embeddings are located near the embeddings of the images they describe.

This example requires TensorFlow 2.4 or higher. In addition, TensorFlow Hub and TensorFlow Text are required for the BERT model, and TensorFlow Addons is required for the AdamW optimizer. These libraries can be installed using the following command:

        x = layers.Dense(projection_dims)(x)
        x = layers.Dropout(dropout_rate)(x)
        x = layers.Add()([projected_embeddings, x])
        projected_embeddings = layers.LayerNormalization()(x)
    return projected_embeddings

Implement the vision encoder
In this example, we use Xception from Keras Applications as the base for the vision encoder.
